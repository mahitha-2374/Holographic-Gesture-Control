# Holographic-Gesture-Control
HoloGesture: Control interfaces with hand gestures.


### **Holographic Gesture Control**  

#### **Overview**  
Holographic Gesture Control is an innovative system that enables users to interact with virtual holographic interfaces using hand gestures. The project leverages **computer vision and deep learning** to recognize gestures and translate them into interactive commands for controlling applications in a holographic environment.  

#### **Features**  
- **Real-time gesture recognition** using OpenCV and MediaPipe  
- **Hand tracking and gesture-based input control**  
- **Integration with holographic display technology** (optional)  
- **Python-based implementation with machine learning models**

### **Installation**  

#### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Holographic-Gesture-Control.git
cd Holographic-Gesture-Control
```

#### **2. Install Dependencies**  
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably 3.7+). Then, install the required libraries:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not available, manually install the required libraries:  
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pyautogui
```

---

### **Usage**  

#### **1. Run the Gesture Recognition Script**  
```bash
python gesture_control.py
```
This will start the webcam and detect hand gestures in real-time.

#### **2. Customize Gesture Actions**  
Modify `gesture_control.py` to map specific gestures to actions like mouse control, volume adjustment, or holographic interface interactions.

### **Troubleshooting**  
- **Webcam Not Detected?** Check if another application is using the camera.  
- **Slow Performance?** Reduce frame processing in `gesture_control.py` by lowering resolution.  
- **Missing Dependencies?** Ensure all required packages are installed using `pip list`.
